# sys-config

An advanced system configuration reference guide.

This repo contains all system configuration stuff that I keep forgetting.

Gentoo and Arch have excellent documentation for all your questions. This is
basically my interpretation.  It contains extra notes of things that are obvious
to the professional wiki creators.

## [All the Networking Ways](networking.md)
- The many ways to configure your system's networking exactly as needed

## [Building a Router](router.md)
- Networking specific to a router

## [Disk Magic](partition.md)
- Partition alignment when creating partitions
- Resizing OS / partitions for backups, copies and image creation

## [Fixing the Console](console.md)
- map caps lock to control
- fix small text size by increasing font size (not by lowering resolution)
